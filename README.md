# JS-Movie-Comparison-App

This is the result of a project I did while completing Colt Steele and Stephen Grider's javascript course.

This project helped me understand fetch requests and how to interpret that data and use it to manipulate the DOM. It also helped me learn to refactor code to be more reuseable across a variety of uses. 

I updated the styling to better reflect when a movie's category loses.
